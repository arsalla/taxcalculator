Rudimentary tax bracket calculator

----------------------------------------------------VERSION 1.0 APRIL 10, 2020----------------------------------------------------
This tax calculator is my attempt to get back into java, really just trying to remember all of the some of the basics when it comes to syntax. There is no GUI for this, may be added later however. This program checks to see if you are a minor, then determines which tax bracket you fall into. 2020 tax bracket rates were used. Tax brackets were determined by filing status (info from debt.org). In the future, I plan to add a GUI, have more in depth analysis of taxes paid, and add more detailed income input section in which different sources of income relate to different tax percentages (capital gains, etc.)
